The value 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b48656c6c6f20576f726c64000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 in Solidity is a hexadecimal encoding of a byte array.

The first 32 bytes (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020) represent the offset to the start of the actual data. This offset indicates the number of bytes that come before the actual data. In this case, the offset is 32 bytes (or 256 bits), indicating that the actual data starts at the 33rd byte.

The remaining bytes (0x0b48656c6c6f20576f726c640000000000000000000000000000000000000000) represent the actual data. This data is encoded in ASCII, where each pair of hexadecimal digits represents a single ASCII character. In this case, the data represents the string "Hello World" padded with zeros to fill up the remaining bytes.

So, in summary, the value 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b48656c6c6f20576f726c64000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 represents a byte array with an offset of 32 bytes and a data value of the ASCII string "Hello World".
