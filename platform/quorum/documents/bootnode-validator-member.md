# [Ethereum Node](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-nodes-and-clients-a-complete-guide/)

 -  **Bootnode**

[bootnode runs a bootstrap node for the Ethereum Discovery Protocol](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/cmd/bootnode/main.go)

 -  **Validator**

`합의 알고리즘 참여 노드`. Validator nodes participate in the consensus and produce blocks and/or chunks. These are just full nodes with the added ability of validating new transactions that should be added to the chain. In order to do so, they possess a private key with which they sign the transactions marking them as valid. In exchange of their work, they get back a reward that is given to them each time a new block is created. Without validator nodes, the whole chain couldn't exist.
